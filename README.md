There are three scripts included in this respository, each used when drafting "Testosterone modulates neural responses to Food Cues in Women with Anorexia".

1) 914_bayes.Rmd is the primary script that includes both 2- and 3-factor models referenced in the paper. Baseline characteristics, model fit statistics as described in the supplement
are also included.

2) 914_data_cleaning.Rmd includes all data cleaning  performed on preprocessed neuroimaging data, as well as behavioral and serologic data.

3) 914_replicate_parent_trial.Rmd includes the analyses detailed in the supplement that replicate the (behavioral and serological, non-neuroimaging) results of this substudy's parent trial, A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Low-Dose Testosterone Therapy in Women With Anorexia Nervosa by Allison Kimball et al.
